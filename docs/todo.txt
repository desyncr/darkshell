1- automate the patch of targets.
	- once there is a shell send the patched ajax_create_folder.php
	- create a shell that accepts custom params etc.
	- customize a shell to work as a command line/from the command line etc (no forms or such)
2- automate the search of targets (google etc)
	- there are already many scripts out there. create my own. not very hard?
	- look for a search engine other than google.
3- automate the explotation of targets.
	- from point 2 when should have a list of possible targets.
	- take that list and try to exploit it.
	- use a set of test and so on to keep track of whats going on why some are not vuln etc.
